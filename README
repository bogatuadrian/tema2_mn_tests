tri-Tester
Copyright (C) 2012 Adrian Bogatu

This is a system of triangular liniar equations generator and tester for
the triCL and triCC methods.


The code is written for GNU Octave, version 3.2.3,
Copyright (C) 2009 John W. Eaton and others.

Use:
  put these files in the implementation of triCL(triCC) directory and
  run testVer() with octave.
  Default parameters:
   - 10 tests
   - maximum 100x100 triangular matrix
   - triCL method

FOR SECOND TASK!
  I added, as I mentioned, a "pseudo"-test, which means that it tests your
  program using both of the sources in tandem, which means that if there is
  an error in both of the implementation you could pass the tests, although
  it's a good testing method...
